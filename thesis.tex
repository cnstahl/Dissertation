% I've found it to be good practice to include the babel package;
% however---don't!  It breaks the appearance of chapter headings.
% \usepackage[english]{babel}

% Your thesis gets printed in color---you can use colors!  This package has
% something to do with enabling that?
\usepackage{color}

% Something about for better accented-word behavior.
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% The original template included this too, but I found it broke things.
% \usepackage[latin9]{inputenc}

% Improved typography.
%\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage{microtype}

% Improved text alignment.
\usepackage{ragged2e}

% To insert figures.
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{chapter-2/figs}, {chapter-3/figs}, {chapter-4/doodles}, {chapter-5/figs}, {chapter-6}}
%
\usepackage{epstopdf}
% For sub-figure support.  I think the subcaption package may be better, but
% that doesn't work with revtex (the document class for Physical Review), so I
% use this one.
\usepackage[caption=false]{subfig}
% Honestly I forget why I included this package...
\usepackage[export]{adjustbox}
% You can use this command to put a box around LaTeX-generated figures.
%\usepackage{longfbox}

% Lists.
%\usepackage{enumitem}

% Proper equation rendering.
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
%\usepackage{bbold}
\usepackage{bm}
\usepackage{mathtools}
% Introduces \bra{} and \ket{} commands.  Never type \rangle again.
\usepackage{braket}

% Now you can typeset spin-1/2 properly: "spin-\nicefrac{1}{2}".
%\usepackage{nicefrac}

% Better unit formatting.  But obviously you don't need units because c = h = 1.
%\usepackage{units}

% For formatting quotes
\usepackage{multicol}

% Improved tables.
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{booktabs}
%\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{dcolumn}
\usepackage{tabularx}
%\usepackage{makecell}
% Alignment in table columns.
\newcolumntype{L}[1]{>{\raggedright\let\newline\\\arraybackslash\hspace{0pt}}m{#1}}
\newcolumntype{C}[1]{>{\centering\let\newline\\\arraybackslash\hspace{0pt}}m{#1}}
\newcolumntype{R}[1]{>{\raggedleft\let\newline\\\arraybackslash\hspace{0pt}}m{#1}}
% Increase table spacing so they're actually legible.
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

% PDF hyper-references (i.e., links between pages).
\usepackage{hyperref}
% This makes hyper-references not hideous.  Without this, links are black text
% with an ugly red box around them.  If you're fine with that, do you even
% deserve to graduate?
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
\hypersetup{
  colorlinks,
  linkcolor={red!50!black},
  citecolor={blue!50!black},
  urlcolor={blue!80!black},
  pdftitle={Exotic Dynamics}
}

% Clever references: stop typing "Equation~\ref{foo}" manually---just type
% \cref{foo} and let LaTeX figure out what kind of thing you're referencing.
% NOTE: This must be loaded after hyperref.
%\usepackage[capitalise,noabbrev]{cleveref}

% Lets you rotate stuff, like full page landscape tables.
%\usepackage{rotating}

% HACK: Add a tiny bit of space atop all floats (figures and tables) to prevent
% them from overlapping with page numbers when positioned at the top of the
% page.  There ought to be a better way...
\makeatletter
\g@addto@macro\@floatboxreset{\vspace{2pt}}
\makeatother

% Lets you patch LaTeX commands.
%\usepackage{etoolbox}
%\usepackage{xpatch}
% For example:
% This makes all the quote environments italicized.
\AtBeginEnvironment{quote}{\itshape}

\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\usepackage{soul}
